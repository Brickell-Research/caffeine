# Phase 3

**Input:** Fully resolved IR objects (top level Organization object)
**Output:** Fully resolved IR objects (top level Organization object)

The third phase of caffeine compilation is the analysis phase where we perform type checking and semantic analysis on the IR objects. This phase does not perform any type of transformation on the IR objects. Instead, we perform a host of checks and verifications to ensure the IR objects are valid and consistent. Once this phase of the compilation is complete, we know that the system instantiations and specifications are correct.
